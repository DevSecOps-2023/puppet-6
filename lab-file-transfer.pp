# Create the file you want to transfer on the Puppet master in the appropriate location.
# For example, if you want to transfer a file named myfile.txt to a node, create the file
# in the Puppet master's file system in a directory such as /etc/puppet/files.
# In the Puppet manifest for the node, add a file resource that specifies the source and destination for the file transfer.

file { '/path/to/myfile.txt':
  ensure => file,
  source => 'puppet:///files/myfile.txt',
  owner  => 'root',
  group  => 'root',
  mode   => '0644',
}

# Replace /path/to/myfile.txt with the path where you want to place the file on the node,
# and puppet:///files/myfile.txt with the Puppet master file path for myfile.txt.
# Run Puppet on the node to initiate the file transfer. The file will be synchronized from
# the Puppet master to the node and placed in the specified location.
